## Description
The project consists in the development of a simple webapp for a telecommunications company, structured in two main parts.
The first one is the "user webapp", which allows customers to register and buy different telecommunication services, grouped in different packages and with the ability to add additional products to the order.
The second one is the "employee webapp", which allows admins to create the packages that the company will sell and to visualize sales data.

The main focus of the project is on the use of Java Enterprise Edition tools for database connectivity:
- JPA for the data persistence and the object-relational mapping (ORM)
- Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) for business logic
- JPQL for querying the database

Used languages and libraries:
- Backend
  - Java
- Frontend and presentation
  - JavaScript
  - HTML5 and CSS
  - Bootstrap library
